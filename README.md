# Cool Reminders 

## Overview

Your brain is an F1 car; your tasks are traffic cones. Chaos ensues. Cool Reminders corrals the cones with color tags, subtasks, and timely nudges, plus optional morning email summaries and a layout you can rearrange to feel just right.

Cool Reminders is a web app for managing multiple to do lists. Users can register and sign in, and after signing in, they can create lists, add tasks, set dates and reminders, and mark tasks complete. They can also organize with color tags, priority filters, nested sections and subtasks, plus optional morning email summaries.
